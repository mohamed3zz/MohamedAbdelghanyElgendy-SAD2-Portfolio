What I learned:
    * In this final project, I learned how to combine SOLID principles with Design Patterns (like Singleton or Factory) to build a complete system.
    * I learned how to document a full project lifecycle.

What was challenging:
    * Combining everything together was the ultimate challenge. This course has been the most difficult experience in my academic life so far.
    * Implementing Design Patterns correctly while following SOLID rules felt almost impossible at times, but I did my best to not give up.

What I improved:
    * I improved my "System Analysis" skills and my ability to look at the big picture of a software project.
    * I am proud that I finished this portfolio and the project despite all the struggles and the difficulty of the material.
