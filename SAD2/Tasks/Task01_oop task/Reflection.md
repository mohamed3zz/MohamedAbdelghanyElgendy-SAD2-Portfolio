 What I learned:
    * I learned how to apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism in a real Java project.
    * I understood how to structure classes and objects to make the code more organized.

What was challenging:
    * This was my first real encounter with the depth of this course, and it was very difficult to translate theoretical OOP concepts into a working system.
    * Understanding the relationship between different classes was a major struggle for me.

What I improved:
    * I improved my ability to trace code and find logical errors in object interactions.
    * Despite the difficulty, I managed to complete the basic structure of the task through hard work.
