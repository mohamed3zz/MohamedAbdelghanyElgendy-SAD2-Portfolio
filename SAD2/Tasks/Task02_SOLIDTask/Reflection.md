What I learned:
    * I learned the five SOLID principles and how they help in creating maintainable and scalable software.
    * I understood why "Single Responsibility" is crucial for reducing code complexity.

What was challenging:
    * Applying SOLID Principles was even harder than the previous task. It felt like I had to rethink everything I knew about coding.
    * Trying to satisfy all the principles at once was overwhelming and was one of the toughest challenges I've faced this semester.

What I improved:
    * I improved my "refactoring" skills—learning how to break down large, complex classes into smaller, more efficient ones.
    * I am becoming more patient with complex requirements despite how stressful they are.
